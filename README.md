## Inspiration
While exploring dijkstra algorithm for finding shortest path between nodes, I came across A* search algorithm which is a better version of it. I wanted to visualise this algorithm while going through the challenge of implementing it in Python. Hence I created the visualiser using Pygame library and implemented the algorithm on it.
## How To Use
- Run "A-star-Algorithm-Visualiser.py"
- Click on any box to mark the starting point, and click again for the end point
- You can draw obstacles now by clicking and dragging
- Boxes can be reset by right click on them
- Press Space Bar key to run the algorithm.
- The green boxes represent the neighours that can be moved to, while the red one's have already been visited
- A final purple path represents the shortest path in manhattan's (L) distance
- Press "C" key to clear surface and start over
